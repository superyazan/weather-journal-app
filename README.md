# Weather-Journal App Project
this is a project for udacity nanodegree
## Overview
This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This required modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. 

## features
it can store history of submission in an array in the endpoint object then this display the latest.
but i kinda thought this will make the object very large by time. so i commented it .
then i made it directly as object keys that  update the value every submission.
